#DXExporter
DXExporter is a 3ds max export plugin for 3DS MAX 2010 that I wrote back in 2010.
This plugin exports mesh and animation data from 3dsmax into a binary format that can be used by graphical
applications.
This plugin also supports skinned meshes.
I will upgrade this project to the latest version and provide proper documentation when I'll have the time.
Till then It's up to you to make it run.
